# OpenGL_Testing
This app tests OpenGL, and we plan to add on to this repo as we explore OpenGL more for a framwork to create our visualization. Following the API provided by Google, this app displays a green triangle with a red background. The Triange, Square, OpenGLView, and OpenGLRendere classes were created to acheive that.
